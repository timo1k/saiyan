# A template to build a full stack app on Aptos

This template is an opinionated alternative template to [CAD (create-aptos-dapp)](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp).

Please read each directory's README carefully to understand how to use the template.

- `indexer` directory for custom indexer on the contract
- `next-app` directory for the Next.js frontend
- `move` directory for the contract and integration tests
- `node-scripts` directory for the some quick scripts to interact with the contract in Node.js
